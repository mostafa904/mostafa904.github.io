## Crack The Hash

i noticed the term `Secret_key` followed by a value i think this is some kind of hash 
first i think to crack this hash in crack station website but i didnt got the value 
->32bit so i think its `MD5` to be sure i took this value to hash analyzer and yes its md5 

i think that this hash is something relative to the user So we can try various strings like name, username, email address, phone number, passwordâ€¦etc.

Trying the email address used to login, I got a match

We now go back to the `Forgot Password` functionality and type in the admin account email and click `send`

So now lets us get the hash for the admin account email address we are trying to takeover.
