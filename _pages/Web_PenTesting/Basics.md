## Client-Server Model

The internet is composed of two kind of devices: clients and servers
* Clients: request resources and servvices from the server 
* Server: Provide those resources & services
EX:
  when you open your browser(firefox) and visit a web site ,it acts as a client and request web page from web server 
  Then the server will provide this page to the browser

## Domain Name System (DNS)

How do your browser know where to find these resources? 
 every device connected to the internet has a `unique IP` 
IP addresses are made up of numbers and letters that are hard for humans
to remember. For example
  `IPv4` looks like this: `123.45.67.89`
  `IPv6` looks even more complicated: `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`

This is where the Domain Name System `DNS` comes in. Think of a DNS server as the internet's directory, converting domain names into IP addresses. When you input a domain name into your browser, the DNS server's job is to translate that name into an IP address. In other words, your browser queries the DNS server, asking, "What is the IP address for this domain?
