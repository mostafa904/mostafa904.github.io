## Client-Server Model

The internet is composed of two kind of devices `clients and servers`
* `Clients`: request resources and servvices from the server 
* `Server`: Provide those resources & services
EX:
  when you open your browser(firefox) and visit a web site ,it acts as a client and request web page from web server 
  Then the server will provide this page to the browser

## Domain Name System (DNS)

How do your browser know where to find these resources? 
 every device connected to the internet has a `unique IP` 
IP addresses are made up of numbers and letters that are hard for humans
to remember. For example
  `IPv4` looks like this: `123.45.67.89`
  `IPv6` looks even more complicated: `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`

This is where the Domain Name System `DNS` comes in. Think of a DNS server as the internet's directory, converting domain names into IP addresses. When you input a domain name into your browser, the DNS server's job is to translate that name into an IP address. In other words, your browser queries the DNS server, asking, "What is the IP address for this domain?

## Internet Ports

After your browser obtains the correct IP address, it will attempt to connect to that IP address via a port.
 `So what is  port  ??`
  a logical division on devices that identifies a specific network service. We identify ports by their port numbers, which can range from 0 to 65,535
Ports allow a server to provide multiple services to the internet at the same time

## HTTP Requests and Responses

Once a connection is established, the browser and server communicate via
the HyperText Transfer Protocol`HTTP`.
`HTTP` is a set of rules that specifies how web clients and web servers should exchange information

<img src="/assets/img/basics/4.png" alt="HTTP">

 consists of an HTTP request and an HTTP response

 let's start by HTTP request here is an examble we will analisys it 

 ```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml
Accept-Language: en-US
Referer: https://mdsec.net/auth/488/Home.ashx
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie: SessionId=5B70C71F3FD4968935CDB6682E545476
 ```
The first line of every HTTP request consists of three items, separated by spaces:

* A verb indicating the HTTP method:
`GET`: To retrieve data from the server
`POST`: To submit data to the server
`PUT` : attempts to upload the specified resource to the server  
`OPTIONS`:returns information about the server `method used`

* The requested URL.
* The HTTP version being used, Common version `1.0 & 1.1`

The rest of the lines are HTTP request headers. These are used to pass
additional information about the request to the server. 
The Cookie header: is used to send cookies from the client to the server

HTTP Response 

* The first line of an HTTP response contains two fields: `HTTP version` and `HTTP response code`
* The next lines contain HTTP header value similar to an http request
* response body is usually like: HTML code, JSON, scripts or a PDF document hosted on the webserver

HTTP Response Codes

* 2xx: when a request succeeds like `200 OK`.
* 3xx: when the server redirects the client like `302 Found`.
* 4xx: when requesting a resource that doesnâ€™t exist or requesting a bad format like
 `400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden and 404 Not Found`.
* 5xx: when there is some problem with HTTP server itself like `500 Internal Server Error`


## Encoding

Our data can't be transmitted in the form of plain text.So websites encode their messages to prevent data corruption
there are many ways to encode the data 
1. <u>Base64 Encoding</u> 
make data safely `user creds` by using ASCII characters`EX: Q29udGVudCBFbmNvZGluZw==`
2. <u>Hexadecimal Encoding</u>
 representing characters in a base-16 format `0 - F`
3. `*URL Encoding*`
Each character in a URL-encoded string can be represented by its designated hex number preceded by a % symbol `EX: %6c%6f%63%61%6c%`
